 INCLUDE IMG

**Issue #2:** Hidden checkboxes and labels for the gallery filter and accordion were inaccessible via keyboard due to the use of `display: none;`. Used for the navigation, including the icons, such as, ☰, which I found from Microsoft word keyboard.

# Bugs, errors and changes

I had received feedback to generate more personalised code after working with this YouTube video to assist me to create this game. I decided to merge the levels for better code readability. I used a range of sources to help me do this, which will be credited throughout this section, as well as the tutor support at code institute. 

First I had 3 java script pages one for each level (easy.js, medium.js, hard.js), I also had 3 htmls liked to each one of the levels. To begin with I decided to create a game.js and copy and paste all the levels are in the same place, this was so I could first establish the game levels, I knew to do this from the first lessons on java in code institute to put the data I have on the sheet first, I incorporate this from the video too :

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
// Establish game levels
const quizData = {
    easy: [
        {
            question: "What is 4 x 4?",
            answers: [
                { text: "24", correct: false },
                { text: "8", correct: false },
                { text: "16", correct: true },
                { text: "18", correct: false },
            ], ...
    
    medium: [
        {
            question: "What is 7 x 8?",
            answers: [
                { text: "45", correct: false },
                { text: "58", correct: false },
                { text: "56", correct: true },
                { text: "48", correct: false },
            ], ...

     hard: [
        {
            question: "What is 23 x 17?",
            answers: [
                { text: "327", correct: false },
                { text: "402", correct: false },
                { text: "391", correct: true },
                { text: "361", correct: false },
            ]
            }, 
    ]
}; ...
```

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp 

As I have now moved all questions, this leaves the remaining code three times, I removed the unwanted repeative code and left this one section as seen below:

```javascript
// Get HTML elements by their IDs
const questionElement = document.getElementById("question");
const answerButtons = document.getElementById("answer-buttons");
const nextButton = document.getElementById("next-btn");

// Variables to keep track of the current question index and the player's score
let currentQuestionIndex = 0;
let score = 0;

// Function to start the quiz by resetting variables and showing the first question
function startQuiz() {
  currentQuestionIndex = 0;
  score = 0;
  updateUI();
}

// Function to update the UI with the current question and answer options
function updateUI() {
  resetState(); // Clear previous question state
  const currentQuestion = questions[currentQuestionIndex];
  const questionNo = currentQuestionIndex + 1;
  questionElement.innerHTML = `${questionNo}. ${currentQuestion.question}`;

  // Create buttons for each answer option and attach event listeners
  currentQuestion.answers.forEach(answer => {
    const button = document.createElement("button");
    button.innerHTML = answer.text;
    button.classList.add("btn");
    answerButtons.appendChild(button);
    if (answer.correct) {
      button.dataset.correct = answer.correct;
    }
    button.addEventListener("click", handleAnswerSelection);
  });
}

// Function to reset the state of the quiz (clear answer buttons and hide next button)
function resetState() {
  nextButton.style.display = "none";
  while (answerButtons.firstChild) {
    answerButtons.removeChild(answerButtons.firstChild);
  }
}

// Function to handle the selection of an answer
function handleAnswerSelection(event) {
  const selectedBtn = event.target;
  const isCorrect = selectedBtn.dataset.correct === "true";
  if (isCorrect) {
    selectedBtn.classList.add("correct");
    score++;
  } else {
    selectedBtn.classList.add("incorrect");
  }
  disableAnswerButtons();
  nextButton.style.display = "block"; // Show the next button
}

// Function to disable all answer buttons after an answer is selected
function disableAnswerButtons() {
  Array.from(answerButtons.children).forEach(button => {
    if (button.dataset.correct === "true") {
      button.classList.add("correct");
    }
    button.disabled = true;
  });
}

// Function to handle the next button click
function handleNextButtonClick() {
  currentQuestionIndex++;
  if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length) {
    updateUI();
  } else {
    showScore();
  }
}

// Function to display the final score at the end of the quiz
function showScore() {
  resetState();
  questionElement.innerHTML = `You scored ${score} out of ${questions.length}!`;
  nextButton.innerHTML = "Play Again?";
  nextButton.style.display = "block";
}

// Event listener for the next button
nextButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length) {
    handleNextButtonClick();
  } else {
    startQuiz(); // If quiz is finished, restart it
  }
});

// Start the quiz when the page loads
startQuiz();this was displayed 3 times so I removed the remainder 2 and saved the code at this point. 
```

Now, as this was now on 1 html and 1 javascript, I needed to add new functions and event listeners for the game so the user will be able to chose the level they want and this will load the correct game :


```javascript
function hideOtherLevels(selectedLevel) {
    const levels = ['easy', 'medium', 'hard'];
    levels.forEach(level => {
        if (level !== selectedLevel) {
            document.getElementById(level).style.display = 'none';
        } else {
            document.getElementById(level).style.display = 'block';
        }
    });
}

// Call appropriate level based on user selection or default
function startGame(level) {
    if (level === 'easy' || level === 'medium' || level === 'hard') {
        startQuiz(level);
    } else {
        // Default to easy level if no level is specified
        startQuiz('easy');
    }
}

// Attach event listeners to start quiz buttons
document.getElementById('easyButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    startGame('easy');
});


document.getElementById("mediumButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
    startGame("medium");
});

document.getElementById("hardButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
    startGame("hard");
});
});
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64712803/change-game-difficulty-javascript 

I attempted to play this game however this did not work, I went back to look at my code and because of the merge, some id elements names were not matched up,  I fixed this bug howeer the game still did not load as it should, I decided to go to Code Institutes Tutor Support who discussed with me the next button was not identified, (GET THE SCREENSHOT) once this was re-written, the game loaded as it should. 

Then I need to figure out how to hide the other levels because that doesn’t work…

Then run through testing …
